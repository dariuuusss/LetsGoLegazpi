            <hr>
            <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              THE 15-METER TALL MONUMENT OF NUESTRA SEÑORA DE SALVACIÓN IN LEGAZPI CITY the biggest image of the Virgin Mary in the Bicol Region.
              THE HEAVENLY MOTHER PATRONESS OF ALBAY.
              Our Lady of Salvation (particularly the original sculpture of Nuestra Señora de Salvación de Joroan enshrined in Tiwi, Albay) was canonically crowned by the Catholic Church, as approved by Pope Paul VI, on 25 August 1976 as the heavenly patroness of Albay Province. It was venerated by Pope John Paul II (now a Saint) during his Papal Visit to Legazpi City on 21 February 1981.
              The iconography of Our Lady of Salvation reflects her role, according to Catholic doctrine, as Co- Redemptrix. The Virgin is portrayed as carrying the Christ Child in her left arm, while her right arm grasps a man by the wrist as he is about to fall into a gaping Hellmouth. An angel kneels at the foot of the Virgin, offering a basket of burning hearts to Christ, who holds a burning heart in his right hand, while his left hand is stretched in a gesture of accepting the hearts.
              The new Monument of Nuestra Señora de Salvación in Legazpi City located along the rotunda of Bgy Dita, Pawa and Tamaoyan, sculptured by Mr. Toi Napay, has a height of 15 meters (49 feet) or equivalent to a 5-storey tall building.</p>
