      <h1>The Creation of Macintosh</h1>
      <p>In the late 1970s, Jef Raskin's vision for an easy-to-use, affordable computer for the average 
        consumer laid the foundation for the Macintosh project at Apple. Partnering with engineer Burrell Smith, 
        they worked on creating a prototype that embodied Raskin's user-friendly vision. Macintosh's revolutionary
        concept aimed to minimize users' awareness of the operating system, introducing mouse gestures and graphic 
        controls for basic tasks—a stark contrast to the command-line interfaces of contemporaries like MS-DOS. 
        However, in January 1981, Steve Jobs took charge of the Macintosh project. Inspired by a visit to Xerox PARC,
         where he saw the groundbreaking GUI technology, Jobs negotiated a deal to gain insights into the Xerox Alto 
         computer and Smalltalk development tools. The final Lisa and Macintosh operating systems incorporated Xerox 
         concepts but also introduced elements like the menu bar, pull-down menus, drag-and-drop, and direct manipulation,
          uniquely crafted by Apple. The Mac ROM, significantly larger than its counterparts, played a crucial role, containing
           key OS code meticulously coded by Andy Hertzfeld. Using clever programming tricks, Hertzfeld optimized assembly 
           language code to conserve precious ROM space. Susan Kare designed the iconic operating system icons, while Bruce
            Horn and Steve Capps contributed to the Macintosh Finder and system utilities. Apple's aggressive marketing 
            strategy, including a dominating 39-page advertisement in Newsweek's 1984 November/December edition, catapulted
             the Macintosh into the spotlight. Surpassing its more sophisticated predecessor, the Lisa, the Macintosh's 
             success led to the development of MacWorks, allowing the Lisa to emulate Macintosh system software. While 
             System 7 eventually integrated some of Lisa's advancements, the Macintosh had firmly established itself as 
             a groundbreaking and user-friendly computing solution.

      <h1>System SOftwares: The first Versions of Macintosh</h1><br><br>
        <h3>System Software 1-4</h3><br>
      <p>
        As Apple pursued the goal of creating a computer with appliance-like simplicity, 
        the early versions of its operating system embodied a seamless integration of 
        software and hardware without explicit distinctions. The software comprised two 
        user-visible files: the System file and the Finder—a file management application 
        that also served as the Desktop display. These files resided in a directory labeled 
        "System Folder," which housed additional resource files such as printer drivers 
        essential for System interaction. Version numbers of the operating system were tied to 
        those of the System and Finder files.<br>

        The evolution of the operating system unfolded through various versions. System 1.0, 1.1, 
        and 2.0 featured the Macintosh File System (MFS), offering virtual folders for file 
        organization within the Finder. However, these folders were exclusive to the Finder and 
        were not visible to other applications. System 2.0 introduced AppleTalk support and accommodated
         the newly introduced LaserWriter.<br>

        System 2.1 marked a significant shift with the introduction of the Hierarchical File System (HFS), 
        bringing real directories into play. This version, designed to support the Hard Disk 20, implemented
         HFS in RAM, maintaining MFS 400K volumes for startup and most floppy disks. The release of System 
         3.0 with the Macintosh Plus officially implemented HFS, introduced 800K startup drives, and supported
          new technologies like SCSI and AppleShare. Notable features included Trash "bulging" when containing 
          files.<br>

        System 4.0, accompanying the Macintosh SE, and System 4.1, shipping with the Macintosh II, catered to 
        the demands of new hardware. These releases marked the first support for color graphics, a significant 
        leap forward. They also introduced features like expansion slots, Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), internal hard
         drives, and, on the Macintosh II, external color displays and the Motorola 68020 processor.<br>

        Despite the advancements, these early releases could only run one application at a time, excluding desk 
        accessories. Workarounds like Multi-Mac or Switcher were employed to overcome this limitation. The version 
        number of the Finder reflected visible changes, showcasing major leaps between 1.x, 4.x, 5.x, and 6.x.<br>

        In the late 1990s, Apple retroactively unified these older releases under a single name, providing a
         retrospective coherence to the evolutionary stages of its pioneering operating system.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>System Software 5</h3><br>
        <p>
          Towards the end of 1987, Apple made a significant stride in the evolution of its Macintosh operating system with
           the introduction of "Apple Macintosh System Software Update 5.0." This marked the first instance where the Macintosh
            operating system became a distinct retail product, packaged with four 800K disks and three manuals, all available
             for $49. Despite the formal labeling of this update as "version 5.0" on the product box, the software itself didn't
             carry this designation. Instead, users and the press commonly referred to it as "System Tools 5.0" due to the disks
              being named System Tools.

          <br>One notable inclusion in System 5 was the introduction of MultiFinder, a groundbreaking extension enabling the
           system to run multiple programs simultaneously. Operating on a cooperative multitasking model, MultiFinder allocated
            time to background applications only when the foreground application relinquished control. This change in system 
            functions allowed existing applications to automatically share time and perform tasks in the background. Users also
             had the option to opt out of MultiFinder, continuing to use a single application at a time.

          <br>While MultiFinder was generally viewed positively, it wasn't without its trade-offs. In a 1990 InfoWorld test of
           multitasking options for PC and Mac, MultiFinder received favorable reviews overall. However, it was noted that its 
           presence led to a halving of the speed of file transfer and printing compared to the single-tasking System 6 without 
           MultiFinder. This trade-off highlighted the delicate balance between the convenience of running multiple applications
            simultaneously and the potential impact on system performance.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>System Software 6</h3><br>
        <p>
          System Software 6, commonly known as "System 6," stands out as a pivotal consolidation release in the evolution of the 
          Macintosh operating system. Representing a complete, stable, and enduring platform, System 6 brought together various 
          advancements to create a cohesive user experience. This release accommodated major hardware introductions, notably providing
           essential support for the 68030 processor and the 1.44 MB SuperDrive, which made its debut with the Macintosh IIx and Macintosh
            SE/30. Subsequent updates further refined the system, incorporating support for specialized features introduced with the
             Macintosh Portable, marking the advent of the first specialized laptop capabilities.<br>

          A notable improvement accompanying System 6 was the unification of version numbers between the Finder and the System. This 
          alignment brought clarity and coherence to the user experience, alleviating the confusion that had arisen from significant 
          differences between earlier systems. With System 6, Apple not only delivered a consolidated and robust operating system but 
          also laid the foundation for a more streamlined and user-friendly interface, setting the stage for the continued evolution of 
          the Macintosh operating system.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>System Software 7</h3><br>
        <p>
          On May 13, 1991, the Macintosh operating system underwent a transformative evolution with the release of System 7. Representing 
          a significant upgrade from its predecessor, System 6, it introduced a comprehensive user interface overhaul, a suite of new applications, 
          enhanced stability, and a multitude of features. Aligned with this release was support for the 68040 Macintosh line, marking a pivotal
           moment in the Macintosh platform's development.<br>

          System 7 ushered in a new era for Macintosh, marked by a surge in model diversity, the transition from 68k to Power Macintosh architecture,
           and the growing prominence of Microsoft Windows. The era also witnessed an increased reliance on computer networking and the unprecedented
            popularity of the Internet.<br>

          One of the standout features of System 7 was its introduction of virtual memory support, a long-anticipated subsystem. Virtual memory, 
          crucial for managing the growing amounts of RAM available, was previously available only through third-party extensions like Virtual from
           Connectix. The transition to 32-bit memory addressing was also pivotal, necessitated by the expanding capabilities of the Motorola 68030 
           CPU and 68020 CPUs with a 68851 PMMU. This marked a shift to "32-bit clean" architecture, where OS code routines utilized the full 32 bits
            of a pointer as an address. To facilitate compatibility with older applications, the "Memory" control panel included a switch to disable 
            this feature.<br>

          Cooperative multitasking, once optional through the MultiFinder in System Software 6, became an integral part of System 7. The release also 
          introduced aliases, akin to symbolic links on Unix, providing shortcuts for files and applications. System extensions were restructured, 
          moving to their own subfolder, and a control panel subfolder was created in the System Folder. With System 7.5, Apple introduced the Extensions
           Manager, simplifying the process of enabling and disabling extensions.<br>

          System 7 expanded the functionality of the Apple menu, allowing users to include frequently used folders and applications by placing aliases
           in an "Apple Menu Items" subfolder. Additionally, it introduced AppleScript, a scripting language for task automation, 32-bit QuickDraw 
           supporting "true color" imaging, and TrueType, an outline font standard.<br>

          A notable change was the reimagination of the Trash. Under System 6, it automatically emptied upon shutdown or, if MultiFinder wasn't running, 
          when launching an application. System 7 transformed the Trash into a special hidden folder, allowing files to persist across reboots until the
           user intentionally chose the "Empty Trash" command. The release of System 7 not only marked a technological leap but laid the groundwork for a
